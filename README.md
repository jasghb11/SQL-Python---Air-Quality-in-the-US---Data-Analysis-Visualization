Who has the best air quality in the US?
The question seems easy enough, but the data tells a more complex picture. This project uses official AQI data from the EPA
to analyze and investigate which regions of the US have the best, and worst, air quality.
The project uses SQL for data hygiene, manipulation, and analysis, and then Python to create visualizations.

The project is divided into 4 files, this README, the source code for the SQL analysis, the source code for the Python
visualiztions, and a report detailing my findings and insights. 

The source file is also available, both on this repository and data.gov.
